## notes for contributors
- please do not commit PDF files
- if you have contributed, then add your name to `CONTRIBUTORS`

## TODO
- check errata in EGA II and onwards
- more consistent use of Proposition/Theorem/Definition/whatever in front of `\sref`s
- lists of notation?
- terminology indices?
- hyperref links to equations (e.g. 3.3.9.1)
- check for any `\unsure` commands in the source
- check that all `\hyperref` references are found
- when this is finished (?!) we should [assign a DOI?](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
- web version? work in progress
- make style guidelines?
- link (M), (G), (T) references
