\begin{env}[14.1.1]
Let $I$ be an ordered set;
a \emph{chain} of elements of $I$ is, by definition, a strictly-increasing finite sequence $i_0<i_1<\ldots<i_n$ of elements of $I$ ($n\geq0$);
by definition, the \emph{length} of this chain is $n$.
If $X$ is a topological space, the set of its \emph{closed irreducible} subsets is ordered by inclusion, and so we have the notion of a \emph{chain} of closed irreducible subsets of $X$.
