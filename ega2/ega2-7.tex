\section{Valuative criteria}
\label{section:II.7}

In this section, we give valuative criteria for separation and properness for a given morphism, that is, criteria which introduce a variable auxiliary scheme of the form $\Spec(A)$, where $A$ is a valuation ring.
Under certain suitable ``Noetherian'' hypotheses, we can refine our criteria and restrict to the case where $A$ is a \emph{discrete} valuation ring.
This will be the only case that we need to concern ourselves with in all that follows, and we introduce arbitrary valuation rings, in the general case, only to discuss the links with the classical study of such objects.
