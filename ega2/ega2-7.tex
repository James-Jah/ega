\section{Valuative criteria}
\label{section:II.7}

In this section, we give valuative criteria for separation and properness for a given morphism, that is, criteria which introduce a variable auxiliary scheme of the form $\Spec(A)$, where $A$ is a valuation ring.
Under certain suitable ``Noetherian'' hypotheses, we can refine our criteria and restrict to the case where $A$ is a \emph{discrete} valuation ring.
This will be the only case that we need to concern ourselves with in all that follows, and we introduce arbitrary valuation rings, in the general case, only to discuss the links with the classical study of such objects.


\subsection{Reminder on valuation rings}
\label{subsection:II.7.1}

\begin{env}[7.1.1]
\label{II.7.1.1}
Amongst the many diverse equivalent properties that characterise valuation rings, we will use the following: a ring $A$ is said to be a \emph{valuation ring} if it is an integral ring which is not a field, and $A$ is \emph{maximal} in the set of local rings strictly contained in the field of fractions $K$ of $A$ under the domination relation \sref[I]{I.8.1.1}.
Recall that a valuation ring is \emph{integrally closed}.
If $A$ is a valuation ring, then so too is $A_\fk{p}$ for any prime ideal $\fk{p}\neq0$ of $A$.
\end{env}

\begin{env}[7.1.2]
\label{II.7.1.2}
Let $K$ be a field, and $A$ a local subring of $K$ that is not a field;
\oldpage[II]{139}
then there exists a valuation ring that both dominates $A$ and has $K$ as its field of fractions (\cite[p.~1-07, lemma~2]{I-1}).

Now let $B$ be a valuation ring, $k$ its residue field, $K$ its field of fractions, and $L$ an extension of $k$.
Then there exists a \emph{complete} valuation ring $C$ that dominates $B$ and whose residue field is $L$.
Indeed, $L$ is the algebraic extension of a pure transcendental extension $L'=k(T_\mu)_{\mu\in M}$;
we know that we can extend the valuation of $B$ corresponding to $B$ to a valuation of $K'=K(T_\mu)_{\mu\in M}$ in such a way that $L'$ is the residue field of this valuation (\cite[p.~98]{II-24});
replacing $B$ by the completion of the ring of this extended valuation, we see that that we can restrict to the case where $B$ is complete and $L$ is an algebraic closure of $k$.
If $\overline{K}$ is an algebraic closure of $K$, we can then extend the valuation that defines $B$ to $\overline{K}$, and the corresponding residue field is an algebraic closure of $k$, as we can see by lifting to $\overline{K}$ the coefficients of a unitary polynomial of $k[T]$.
We are thus finally led to the case where $L=k$, and it then suffices to take $C$ to be the completion of $B$ in order to satisfy our claim.
\end{env}

\begin{env}[7.1.3]
\label{II.7.1.3}
Let $K$ be a field, and $A$ a subring of $K$;
the integral closure $A'$ of $A$ in $K$ is the intersection of the valuation rings that contain $A$ and have $K$ as their field of fractions (\cite[p.~51, th.~2]{I-11}).
Proposition~\sref{II.7.1.2} can then be expressed geometrically in an equivalent form:
\end{env}

\begin{proposition}[7.1.4]
\label{II.7.1.4}
Let $Y$ be a prescheme, $p:X\to Y$ a morphism, $x$ a point of $X$, $y=p(x)$, and $y'\neq y$ a specialisation \sref[0]{0.2.1.2} of $y$.
Then there exists a local scheme $Y'$ which is the spectrum of some valuation ring, and a separated morphism $f:Y'\to Y$ such that, denoting the unique closed point of $Y'$ by $a$ and the generic point of $Y'$ by $b$, we have $f(a)=y'$ and $f(b)=y$.
We can furthermore suppose that one of the two additional following properties are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\rm{(i)}] $Y'$ is the spectrum of a complete valuation ring whose residue field is algebraically closed, and there exists a $\kres(y)$-homomorphism $\kres(x)\to\kres(b)$.
    \item[\rm{(ii)}] There exists a $\kres(y)$-isomorphism $\kres(x)\xrightarrow{\sim}\kres(b)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-II.7.1.4}
Let $Y_1$ be the reduced closed subprescheme of $Y$ that has $\overline\{y\}$ as its underlying space \sref[I]{I.5.2.1}, and let $X_1$ be the closed subprescheme given by the inverse image $p^{-1}(Y_1)$;
since $y'\in\overline{\{y\}}$ by hypothesis, and since $\kres(x)$ is the same in $X$ and in $X_1$, we can assume that $Y$ is \emph{integral}, with generic point $y$;
$\sh{O}_{y'}$ is then an integral local ring that is not a field, and whose field of fractions is $\sh{O}_y=\kres(y)$, and $\kres(x)$ is then an extension of $\kres(y)$.
To satisfy the conditions $f(a)=y'$ and $f(b)=y$ as well as the additional condition (i) (resp. (ii)), we take $Y'=\Spec(A')$, where $A'$ is a valuation ring that dominates $\sh{O}_{y'}$ (resp. a valuation ring that dominates $\sh{O}_{y'}$ and whose field of fractions is $\kres(x)$);
the existence such an of $A'$ is guaranteed by \sref{II.7.1.2}.
\end{proof}

\begin{env}[7.1.5]
\label{II.7.1.5}
Recall that a local ring $A$ is said to be \emph{of dimension 1} if there exists a prime ideal distinct from the maximal ideal $\fk{m}$, and if every prime ideal of $A$ distinct from $\fm{m}$ is a \emph{minimal} prime ideal;
when $A$ is \emph{integral}, it is equivalent to ask that $\fk{m}$ and $(0)$ be the only prime ideals, with $\fk{m}\neq(0)$;
in other words, $Y=\Spec(A)$ consists of two
\oldpage[II]{140}
points $a$ and $b$: $a$ is the unique \emph{closed} point, we have $\fk{j}_a=\fk{m}$, and $\kres(a)=k$ is the \emph{residue field} $k=A/\fk{m}$;
$b$ is the \emph{generic point} of $Y$, $\fk{j}_b=(0)$, with the set $\{b\}$ being the unique open subset of $Y$ distinct from both $\emp$ and $Y$ (an open subset which is thus \emph{everywhere dense}), and $\kres(b)=K$ is the \emph{field of fractions} of $A$.
\end{env}

\begin{env}[7.1.6]
\label{II.7.1.6}
For a local ring $A$, Noetherian and of dimension 1, we know (\cite[pp.~2-08 and 17-01]{I-1}) that the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $A$ is normal;
    \item[(b)] $A$ is regular;
    \item[(c)] $A$ is a valuation ring;
\end{enumerate}
furthermore, $A$ is then a \emph{discrete valuation ring}.
Propositions~\sref{II.7.1.2} and \sref{II.7.1.3} then have the following analogues for discrete valuation rings:
\end{env}

\begin{proposition}[7.1.7]
\label{II.7.1.7}
Let $A$ be an integral local Noetherian ring that is not a field, $K$ its field of fractions, and $L$ an extension of finite type of $K$;
then there exists a discrete valuation ring that dominates $A$ and has $L$ as its field of fractions.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\label{proof-II.7.1.7}
Suppose first of all that $L=K$.
Let $\fk{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$, $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ a system of non-null generators of $\fk{m}$, and $B$ the subring $A[x_2/x_1,\ldots,x_n/x_1]$ of $K$, which is Noetherian.
It is immediate that the ideal $\fk{m}B$ of $B$ is identical to the principal ideal $x_1B$;
if $\fk{p}$ is a minimal prime ideal of $x_1B$, then $\fk{p}$ is of rank 1 (\cite[t.~I, p.~277]{I-13});
in other words, $B_\fk{p}$ is a local Noetherian ring \emph{of dimension 1};
it is clear that $\fk{p}B_\fk{p}\cap A$ is an ideal of $A$ that contains $\fk{m}$ and that does not contain $1$, and is thus equal to $\fk{m}$, and so $B_\fk{p}$ \emph{dominates} $A$ \sref[I]{I.8.1.1}.
It follows from the Krull-Akizuki Theorem (\cite[p.~293]{II-25}) that the integral closure $C$ of $B_\fk{p}$ is a Noetherian ring (even though $C$ is not necessarily a $B_\fk{p}$-module of finite type);
if $\fk{n}$ is a maximal ideal of $C$, then $C_\fk{n}$ is a normal local Noetherian ring of dimension 1 (\cite[p.~295]{II-25}), and thus a discrete valuation ring that dominates $B_\fk{p}$ and \emph{a fortiori} $A$.

Now, if $L$ is an extension of finite type of $K$, we can, by the above, restrict to the case where $A$ is already a discrete valuation ring.
Let $w$ be a valuation of $K$ associated to $A$;
there exists a discrete valuation $w'$ of $L$ that \emph{extends} $w$: we can restrict, by induction on the number of generators of $L$, to the case where $L=K(\alpha)$, and then the proposition is classical (\cite[p.~106]{II-24}).
\end{proof}
