\begin{notation}[2.1.1]
\label{II.2.1.1}
Given a ring $S$ \emph{graded} in positive degrees, we denote by $S_n$ the subset of $S$ consisting of homogeneous elements of degree $n$ ($n\geq 0$), by $S_+$ the (direct) sum of the $S_n$ for $n>0$;
we have $1\in S_0$, $S_0$ is a subring of $S$, $S_+$ is a graded ideal of $S$, and $S$ is the direct sum of $S_0$ and $S_+$.
If $M$ is a \emph{graded} module over $S$ (with positive or negative degrees), we similarly denote by $M_n$ the $S_0$-module consisting of homogeneous elements of $M$ of degree $n$ (with $n\in\bb{Z}$).

For every integer $d>0$, we denote by $S^{(d)}$ the direct sum of the $S_{nd}$;
by considering the elements of $S_{nd}$ as homogeneous of degree $n$, the $S_{nd}$ define on $S^{(d)}$ a graded ring structure.

For every integer $k$ such that $0\leq k\leq d-1$, we denote by $M^{(d,k)}$ the direct sum
\oldpage[II]{20}
of the $M_{nd+k}$ ($n\in\bb{Z}$);
this is a graded $S^{(d)}$-module when we consider the elements of $M_{nd+k}$ as homogeneous of degree $n$.
We write $M^{(d)}$ in place of $M^{(d,0)}$.

With the above notation, for every integer $n$ (positive or negative), we denote by $M(n)$ the graded $S$-module defined by $(M(n))_k=M_{n+k}$ for every $k\in\bb{Z}$.
In particular, $S(n)$ will be a graded $S$-module such that $(S(n))_k=S_{n+k}$, by agreeing to set $S_n=0$ for $n<0$.
We say that a graded $S$-module $M$ is \emph{free} if it is isomorphic, considered as a \emph{graded} module, to a direct sum of modules of the form $S(n)$;
as $S(n)$ is a monogeneous $S$-module, generated by the element $1$ of $S$ considered as an element of degree $-n$, it is equivalent to say that $M$ admits a \emph{basis} over $S$ consisting of \emph{homogeneous} elements.

We say that a graded $S$-module $M$ \emph{admits a finite presentation} if there exists an exact sequence $P\to Q\to M\to 0$, where $P$ and $Q$ are finite direct sums of modules of the form $S(n)$ and the homomorphisms are of degree $0$ (cf.~\sref{II.2.1.2}).
\end{notation}

\begin{env}[2.1.2]
\label{II.2.1.2}
Let $M$ and $N$ be two graded $S$-modules;
we define on $M\otimes_S N$ a \emph{graded} $S$-module structure in the following way.
On the tensor product $M\otimes_\bb{Z}N$, we can define a graded $\bb{Z}$-module structure (where $\bb{Z}$ is graded by $\bb{Z}_0=\bb{Z}$, $\bb{Z}_n=0$ for $n\neq 0$) by setting $(M\otimes_\bb{Z}N)_q=\bigoplus_{m+n=q}M_m\otimes_\bb{Z}N_n$ (as $M$ and $N$ are respectively direct sums of the $M_m$ and the $N_n$, we know that we can canonically identify $M\otimes_\bb{Z}N$ with the direct sum of all the $M_m\otimes_\bb{Z}N_n$).
This being so, we have $M\otimes_S N=(M\otimes_\bb{Z}N)/P$, where $P$ is the $\bb{Z}$-submodule of $M\otimes_\bb{Z}N$ generated by the elements $(xs)\otimes y-x\otimes(sy)$ for $x\in M$, $y\in N$, $s\in S$;
it is clear that $P$ is a \emph{graded} $\bb{Z}$-submodule of $M\otimes_\bb{Z}N$, and we see immediately that we obtain a graded $S$-module structure on $M\otimes_S N$ by passing to the quotient.

For two graded $S$-modules $M$ and $N$, recall that a homomorphism $u:M\to N$ of $S$-modules is said to be \emph{of degree $k$} if $u(M_j)\subset N_{j+k}$ for all $j\in\bb{Z}$.
If $H_n$ denotes the set of all the homomorphisms of degree $n$ from $M$ to $N$, then we denote by $\Hom_S(M,N)$ the (direct) \emph{sum} of the $H_n$ ($n\in\bb{Z}$) in the $S$-module $H$ of all the homomorphisms (of $S$-modules) from $M$ to $N$;
in general, $\Hom_S(M,N)$ is not equal to the later.
However, we have $H=\Hom_S(M,N)$ when $M$ is \emph{of finite type};
indeed, we can then suppose that $M$ is generated by a finite number of homogeneous elements $x_i$ ($1\leq i\leq n$), and every homomorphism $u\in H$ can be written in a unique way as $\sum_{k\in\bb{Z}}u_k$, where for each $k$, $u_k(x_i)$ is equal to the homogeneous component of degree $k+\deg(x_i)$ of $u(x_i)$ ($1\leq i\leq n$), which implies that $u_k=0$ except for a finite number of indices;
we have by definition that $u_k\in H_k$, hence the conclusion.

We say that the elements of degree $0$ of $\Hom_S(M,N)$ are the \emph{homomorphisms of graded $S$-modules}.
It is clear that $S_m H_n\subset H_{m+n}$, so the $H_n$ define on $\Hom_S(M,N)$ a graded $S$-module structure.

It follows immediately from these definitions that we have
\[
\label{II.2.1.2.1}
  M(m)\otimes_S N(n)=(M\otimes_S N)(m+n),
  \tag{2.1.2.1}
\]
\[
\label{II.2.1.2.2}
  \Hom_S(M(m),N(n))=(\Hom_S(M,N))(n-m),
  \tag{2.1.2.2}
\]
for two graded $S$-modules $M$ and $N$.

\oldpage[II]{21}
Let $S$ and $S'$ be two graded rings;
a homomorphism of \emph{graded rings $\vphi:S\to S'$} is a homomorphism of rings such that $\vphi(S_n)\subset S_n'$ for all $n\in\bb{Z}$ (in other words, $\vphi$ must be a homomorphism \emph{of degree $0$} of graded $\bb{Z}$-modules).
The data of such a homomorphism defines on $S'$ a \emph{graded} $S'$-module structure;
equipped with this structure and its graded ring structure, we say that $S'$ is a \emph{graded $S'$-algebra}.

If $M$ is also a graded $S$-module, then the tensor product $M\otimes_S S'$ of \emph{graded} $S$-modules is equipped in a natural way with a \emph{graded} $S'$-module structure, the grading being defined as above.
