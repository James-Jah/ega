\section{Differential invariants. Differentially smooth morphisms}
\label{section:IV.16}

\oldpage[IV-4]{5}
In this paragraph we will present, in global form, some notions of differential calculus particularly useful in algebraic geometry.
We will ignore many classic developments in differential geometry (connections, infinitesimal transformations associated to vector fields, jets, etc.), although these notions are translated in a particularly natural way for schemes.
We will similarly ignore phenomena exclusive to characteristic $p>0$ (some of which are seen, in the affine case, in \hyperref[section:0.21]{(\textbf{0}, 21)}.
For certain complements to the differential formalism for preschemes the reader may consult Expos\'es~II and VII of \cite{SGA3} as well as subsequent chapters of this treatise.

\subsection{Normal invariants of an immersion}
\label{IV.16.1}

\begin{env}[16.1.1]
\label{IV.16.1.1}

Let $(X, \sh{O}_X), (Y, \sh{O}_Y)$ be two ringed spaces and $f = (\psi, \theta): Y \to X$ a morphism of ringed spaces \sref[0]{0.4.1.1} such that the homomorphism
\[
  \theta^\#: \psi^*(\sh{O}_X) \to \sh{O}_Y
\]
is surjective, so that $\sh{O}_Y$ is identified with a sheaf of quotient rings $\psi^*(\sh{O}_X)/\sh{I}_f$. 
We can then endow $\psi^*(\sh{O}_X)$ with the $\sh{I}_f$-preadic filtration.
\end{env}

\begin{definition}[16.1.2]
\label{IV.16.1.2}
The $\sh{O}_Y$-augmented sheaf of rings $\psi^*(\sh{O}_X)/\sh{I}_f^{n+1}$ is called the $n$'th \emph{normal invariant} of $f$;
the ringed space $(Y, \psi^*(\sh{O}_X)/\sh{I}_f^{n+1})$ is called the $n$'th \emph{infinitesimal neighbourhood} of $Y$ along $f$ and is denoted by $Y^{(n)}_f$ or simply $Y^{(n)}$.
The sheaf of graded rings associated to the sheaf of filtered rings $\psi^*(\sh{O}_X)$
\[
  \label{IV.16.1.2.1}
  \shGr_\bullet(f) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0}(\sh{I}_f^{n}/\sh{I}_f^{n+1} )
  \tag{16.1.2.1}
\]
is called the sheaf of graded rings \emph{associated to} $f$. The sheaf $\shGr_1(f) = \sh{I}_f/\sh{I}_f^{2}$ is called the \emph{conormal sheaf} of $f$ (that will be denoted by $\sh{N}_{Y/X}$ when there is no risk of confusion). 
\end{definition}

It is clear that the $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}} = \psi^*(\sh{O}_X)/\sh{I}_f^{n+1}$ (that we also denote $\sh{O}_{Y_f^{(n)}})$ form a
\oldpage[IV-4]{6}
projective system of sheaves of rings on $Y$, the transition homomorphism $\phi_{nm}:\sh{O}_{Y^{(m)}} \to \sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ for $n \leq m$ identifies $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ with the quotient of $\sh{O}_{Y^{(m)}}$ by the power $(\sh{I}_f/\sh{I}_f^{n+1} )^m$ of the \emph{agumentation ideal} of $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$, kernel of $\phi_{0n}: \sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}} \to \sh{O}_{Y}$.
The $Y^{(n)}$ therefore form a inductive system of ringed spaces, all having underlying space $Y$, and we have canonical morphisms of ringed spaces $h_n: Y^{(n)} \to X$ equal to $(\psi, \theta_n)$, where $\theta^\#_n$ is the canonical morphism $\psi^*(\sh{O}_X) \to \psi^*(\sh{O}_X)/\sh{I}_f^{n+1}$.
It is clear that the sheaf $\shGr_\bullet(f)$ is a sheaf of graded algebras over the sheaf of rings $\sh{O}_Y = \shGr_0(f)$ and the $\shGr_k(f)$ of $\sh{O}_Y$-modules.

As with every sheaf of filtered rings, we have a \emph{canonical surjective homomorphism} of graded $\sh{O}_Y$-algebras
\[
  \label{IV.16.1.2.2}
  \bb{S}_{\shGr_1(f)}^\bullet \to \shGr_\bullet(f)
  \tag{16.1.2.2}
\]
which coincide in degrees $0$ and $1$ with the identities.

\begin{examples}[16.1.3]
\label{IV.16.1.3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)] Suppose that $X$ is a locally ringed space, $Y$ is reduced to a single point $y$ (endowed with a ring $\sh{O}_y$) and that, if $x = \psi(y)$, $\theta^\#:\sh{O}_x \to \sh{O}_y$ is a \emph{surjective} homomorphism of rings having as kernel the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_x$ of $\sh{O}_x$.
  So the $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ are identified with the rings $\sh{O}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^{n+1}$ and $\shGr_\bullet(f)$ with the graded ring associated with the local ring $\sh{O}_x$ endowed with the $\mathfrak{m}_x$-preadic filtration.
  \item[(ii)] Suppose that $Y$ is a closed subset of an open subspace $U$ of $X$ and that the $\sh{O}_Y$ is induced on $Y$ by a quotient sheaf $\sh{O}_U/\sh{I}$, where $\sh{I}$ is an ideal of $\sh{O}_U$ such that $\sh{I}_x = \sh{O}_x$ for every $x \notin Y$;
  if $X$ is a locally ringed space we also suppose that $\sh{I}_x \neq \sh{O}_x$ for $y \in Y$ so that $(Y, \sh{O}_Y)$ is a locally ringed space.
  
  Let $\psi_0: Y \to U$ be the canonical injection and denote by $\theta_0: \sh{O}_U \to (\psi_0)_*(\sh{O}_Y)$ the homomorphism such that $\theta_0^\#$ is the canonical homomorphism $\psi^*_0(\sh{O}_U) = \sh{O}_U|Y \to (\sh{O}_U/\sh{I})|Y$, so that $j_0=(\psi_0, \theta_0):Y \to U$ is a morphism of ringed spaces (and of locally ringed spaces if $X$ is a locally ringed space);
  if $i:U \to X$ is the canonical injection (morphism of ringed spaces), $j = i\circ j_0$ is the morphism $(\psi, \theta)$ of $Y$ to $X$ where $\psi: Y \to X$ is the canonical injection and $\theta:\sh{O}_X \to \psi_*(\sh{O}_Y)$ is the homomorphism such that $\theta^\# = \theta_0^\#$.
  Since $\theta^\#$ is surjective we can apply the previous definitions;
  $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ is equal to $\psi^*_0(\sh{O}_U/\sh{I}^{n+1})$, and we have $(\psi_0)_*(\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}} ) = \sh{O}_U/\sh{I}^{n+1}$, and $\shGr_n(j) = \shGr_n(j_0) = \psi^*_0(\sh{I}^n/\sh{I}^{n+1}) = j^*_0(\sh{I}^n/\sh{I}^{n+1})$.
  %I am pretty sure it should be \psi^* instead of j^*_0 in the last line... ~solov-t
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

\begin{env}[16.1.4]
\label{IV.16.1.4}
The example \sref{IV.16.1.3}[ii] shows that in general the $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ are \emph{not canonically endowed with a structure of $\sh{O}_Y$-module}, or \emph{a fortiori} with a structure of $\sh{O}_Y$-algebra.
The data of such structure is equivalent to the data of a homomorphism of sheaves of rings $\lambda_n:\sh{O}_Y \to \sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$, right inverse to the augmentation morphism $\phi_{0n}$;
it is also equivalent to the data of a morphism of ringed spaces $(I_Y, \lambda_n): Y^{(n)} \to Y$ right inverse to the canonical morphism $(I_Y, \phi_{0n}): Y \to Y^{(n)}$.
\end{env}

\begin{proposition}[16.1.5]
\label{IV.16.1.6}
Let $f = (\psi, \theta): Y \to X$ be an immersion of preschemes. We have:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)] $\shGr_\bullet(f)$ is a quasi-coherent graded $\sh{O}_Y$-algebra.
\oldpage[IV-4]{7}
  \item[(ii)] The $Y^{(n)}$ are preschemes, canonically isomorphic to subpreschemes of $X$.
  \item[(iii)] Every homomorphism of sheaves of rings $\lambda_n: \sh{O}_Y \to \sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$, right inverse to the augmentation homomorphism $\phi_{0n}$, makes the $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ and $\sh{O}_{Y^{(k)}}$ for $k\leq n$ quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_Y$-algebras;
  the structure of $\sh{O}_Y$-module deducted from the preceding structures on the $\shGr_k(f)$ for $k \leq n$ coincide with the ones defined in \sref{IV.16.1.2}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
(i) Since the question is local on $X$ and $Y$, we can reduce to the case where $Y$ is a closed subpreschemes of $X$ defined by an quasi-coherent ideal $\sh{I}$ of $\sh{O}_X$;
since $\sh{O}_Y$ is the restriction to $Y$ of $\sh{O}_X/\sh{I}$ the assertion (i) is evident, and $Y^{(n)}$ is the closed subprescheme of $X$ defined by the quasi-coherent ideal $\sh{I}^{n+1}$ of $\sh{O}_X$.
Finally, to prove (iii) we notice that the data of $\lambda_n$ makes the ideal $\sh{I}/\sh{I}^n$ of the augmentation $\phi_{0n}$ and their quotients $\sh{I}/\sh{I}^{k+1} (1\leq k \leq n)$ $\sh{O}_Y$-modules, and it suffices to prove by induction on $k$ that the $\sh{I}/\sh{I}^{k+1}$ are quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_Y$-modules and the structure of quotient $\sh{O}_Y$-module induced on $\sh{I}^k/\sh{I}^{k+1}$ is the same as defined on \sref{IV.16.1.2}.
The second assertion is immediate, $\sh{I}^k/\sh{I}^{k+1}$ being killed by $\sh{I}/\sh{I}^{n+1}$;
the first result, by induction on $k$, is trivial for $k=1$ and for $\sh{I}/\sh{I}^{k+1}$ being an extension of $\sh{I}/\sh{I}^{k}$ by $\sh{I}^k/\sh{I}^{k+1}$ \hyperref[section:III.1.4.17]{(\textbf{III}, 1.4.17)}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[16.1.6]
\label{IV.16.1.6}
Under the general hypothesis of \sref{IV.16.1.5}, if the immersion $f$ is locally of finite presentation then the $\shGr_n(f)$ are quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_Y$-modules of finite type.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Indeed, with the notation of the demonstration of \sref{IV.16.1.5}, $\sh{I}$ is an ideal of finite type of $\sh{O}_X$ \sref{IV.1.4.7}, therefore the $\sh{I}^n/\sh{I}^{n+1}$ are $\sh{O}_Y$-modules of finite type, hence the conclusion.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[16.1.7]
\label{IV.16.1.7}
Under the general hypothesis of \sref{IV.16.1.5}, let $g:X \to Y$ be a morphism of preschemes left inverse to $f$.
Therefore, for every $n$, the composite morphism $(I, \lambda_n): Y^{(n)}\xrightarrow{h_n} X \xrightarrow{g} Y$ defines a homomorphism of sheaves of rings $\lambda_n: \sh{O}_Y \to \sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ right inverse to the augmentation $\phi_{0n}$, making $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ a quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_Y$-algebra;
via these homomorphisms, the transition homomorphism $\phi_{nm}:\sh{O}_{Y^{(m)}} \to \sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}} (n \leq m)$ are homomorphisms of $\sh{O}_Y$-algebras. 
Also, if $g$ is locally of finite type, then the $\sh{O}_{Y^{(n)}}$ are quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_Y$-modules of finite type.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The first assertion is an immediate result from the definitions and \sref{IV.16.1.5}. For the other part, if $g$ is locally of finite type then $f$ is locally of finite presentation \sref{IV.1.4.3}[(v)];
the $\shGr_n(f)$ being then quasi-coherent $\sh{O}_Y$-modules of finite type by \sref{IV.16.1.6}, the same goes for the $\sh{O}_Y$-modules $\sh{I}/\sh{I}^{n+1}$, being extensions of a finite number of the $\shGr_k(f)$ \sref[III]{III.1.4.17}.
\end{proof}
