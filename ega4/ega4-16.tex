\section{Differential invariants. Differentially smooth morphisms}
\label{section:IV.16}

\oldpage[IV-4]{5}
In this paragraph we will present, in global form, some notions of differential calculus particularly useful in algebraic geometry.
We will ignore many classic developments in differential geometry (connections, infinitesimal transformations associated to vector fields, jets, etc.), although these notions are translated in a particularly natural way for schemes.
We will similarly ignore phenomena exclusive to characteristic $p>0$ (some of which are seen, in the affine case, in \hyperref[section:0.21]{(\textbf{0}, 21)}).
For certain complements to the differential formalism for preschemes the reader may consult Expos\'es~II and IV of \cite{SGA3} as well as subsequent chapters of this treatise.
