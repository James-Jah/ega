These are mostly modified scripts from the [stacks project](https://github.com/stacks/stacks-project).
For a copy of the licence, see [here](https://github.com/stacks/stacks-project/blob/master/COPYING).

The scripts I'm currently using to serve the website are very specialized for my system.
If you are interested in how it's working, then please email me.
